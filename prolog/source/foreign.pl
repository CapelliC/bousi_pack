%% ext_closure(+InputEquations, +Closure, +TNorm, +RelationName, -OutputEquations)
%
%    Computes the reflexive, symmetric and/or transitive closure of
%     the fuzzy relation defined by a set of equations and returns the
%     list of equations of the resulting fuzzy relation. Input
%     equations must be like "rel(a, b, 0.5)", where "rel" can be any
%     functor; output equations will be similar but replacing "rel"
%     with RelationName atom.
%     Closure must be a combination of one or more of these flags:
%      * 1: Reflexive
%      * 2: Symmetric
%      * 4: Transitive
%     TNorm must be one of these values:
%      * 1: Minimum
%      * 2: GÃ¶del
%      * 3: Lukasiewicz
%


%% ext_translate_fuzzysets(+Domain, +Subsets, +NewSubsets, +RelationName, -Equations)
%
%     Computes the similarity degree between the fuzzy subsets of the
%     NewSubsets list and the fuzzy subsets of the Subsets list, and
%     returns a list of equations that represent a fuzzy relation with
%     the subsets in NewSubsets.
%     Domain must be a list with four items: [Name, Min, Max,
%     MeasureUnit]. Output equations will be like "rel(a, b, 0.5)",
%     where "rel" is RelationName atom, and "a"/"b" are subsets' names.
%     Finally, these are the syntax of the valid fuzzy subsets:
%      * name(A, B, C, D): trapezoidal subset.
%      * name(A, B, C): triangular subset.
%      * name(point(X)): domain point.
%      * name(about(X)): fuzzy domain point.
%      * name(between(X, Y)): domain range.
%      * name(about(X, Y)): fuzzy domain range.
%      * name(modifier(Subset)): modifier subset (valid modifiers are
%        "very", "extremely", "more_or_less", and "somewhat").
%


%% ext_tokenize(+StringAtom, -Tokens)
%
%     Scans the Bousi-Prolog program or query contained in StringAtom,
%     performs a lexical analysis and returns a list with all the tokens
%     found. Each token will be defined by a compound term of arity 2
%     with this syntax: "<type>(<text>, [<line>, <column>])" (e.g.
%    "comma(',', [3, 5])" or "name('aaa bbb', [10, 15])").
%


%% ext_read_shell_line(+Prompt, -String, -Arguments)
% 
%     Reads a line from standard input using editline library, which
%     allows command-line editing and history features. The line entered
%     by the user is returned as an atom in String. A list with all the
%     arguments found in the line (using space-bar characters as
%     delimiters) is returned in Arguments.
%


%% ext_load_shell_history(+File)
%
%     Loads command history used by editline library from File. If File
%     doesn't exist, it'll be created.
%


%% ext_save_shell_history(+File, +MaxCommands)
%
%     Saves command history used by editline library in File, storing
%     no more commands than the specified in MaxCommands. If File
%     already exists, it'll be overwritten.
%


%% ext_set_system_predicate_list(+List)
%
%     Sets the list of predefined predicates available in Bousi-Prolog.
%     This list will be used by shell's autocomplete feature.
%


%% ext_set_program_predicate_list(+List)
%
%     Sets the list of predicates defined in the currently loaded
%     program. This list will be used by shell's autocomplete feature.
